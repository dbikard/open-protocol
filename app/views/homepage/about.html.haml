  %h2 About Us
  %p
    OpenProtocol is a place to share the most fundamental unit of a research project: the experimental protocol. With a protocol in hand, any researcher can replicate an experiment they've read about, or adopt a technique for their own purposes. Questions? Get in touch:

  %h2 Here's how you can use openProtocol
  %h3 Researchers
  %p
    Using openProtocol means all of you protocols will be in one place, beautifully formatted, and ready to be printed or annotated whenever you like. No more hunting around for that dogeared copy of the manual or relying on handwritten notes that postdoc gave you in 1998. Additionally, using openProtocol allows you to quickly find trusted protocols for any procedure, as well as share your own solutions with colleagues.
  %h3 Hobbyists
  %p
    OpenProtocol gives you access to the cutting edge of any technique, and further allows you to share your own work with the rest of the scientific public at large. Much of the inspiration for this project came from the open spirit of the DIY community, and we hope to be a useful tool for DIY Bio-ers everywhere!
  %h3 Teachers
  %p
    OpenProtocol contains experimental protocols for your lab science classes that have been tested by other classes around the world! By using an openProtocol experiment in your class, your students will be doing real science, and will also have a chance to contribute their own experience to improving protocols used by students in your own and other countries.

  %h2 Our story
  %p
    OpenProtocol got its start as a student project during the summer of 2009 at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Paris. The funding for this work has been generously provided by the CRI and the Fondation Bettencourt.
